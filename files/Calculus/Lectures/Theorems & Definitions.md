**Definition of an inverse function:**
Suppose $f$ is a function with domain $D$ and range $R$.
A function $g$ is the inverse of $f$ 
if for all $x$ in $D$ and $y$ in $R$ the following holds:
$$
f(x)= y\Leftrightarrow x = g(y)
$$

**Theorem (left and right) limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L \Leftrightarrow \lim_{x \to a^+}f(x) = L = \lim_{x \to a^-}f(x)
$$

**Intermediate value theorem**:
Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, where $f(a) \neq f(b)$. Then there exists number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$
