**Information, Data and Knowledge**
****
- **Data** = raw, unprocessed facts
	- Observations
	- Symbols
	- Signals
- **Information** = data that has been structured or contextualised
- **Knowledge** = information interpreted through experience or expertise
- **Wisdom** = knowing the right thing to do

---
**Artificial Intelligence**
****
- A deep learning model is only as good as:
	1. **the data it gets.**
	2. **the objective it optimizes.**

**Data management** is foundational in creating deep learning systems.

**Into Databases**
****
- **Database** = a collection of related data represented using a data model and a defined data schema.
- **Database Management System (DBMS)** = a software system managing and maintaining a database.

1. **Data Integrity & Concurrency**
	- Rules & constraint to ensure data stays reliable
2. **Concurrency Control**
	- Allows multiple people access data at the same time
3. **Querying & Flexibility**
	- Have languages to find and manipulate data quickly
4. **Scalability & Performance**
5. **Security & Access Control**
	- Control access, require authentication and track who did what
6. **Backup & Recovery**
	- Automated backup and tools to recover data after crashes

**Tier 1 Architecture:** apps & database on single local device.

**Tier 2 Architecture**: apps & users (client) talk to database over a network
