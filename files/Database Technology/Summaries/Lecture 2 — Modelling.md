## Lecture Slides
****
**Lecture Goals**
****
- Engineering & Computer Science
- Why Modelling?
- Introduction to Entity-Relationshop Diagrams (ER)

****
**Engineering**
****
- **Goal**: Applies scientific and technical principles to design and build solutions, assess and maintain them
- **Focus**: Systems, infrastructure, machine, processes
- **Output**: Physical or digital products that solve real-world problems
- **Mindset**: "How can I address this problem systematically, reliably and safely"

****
**Scientist**
****
- **Goal**: Expands knowledge by discovering new truths about nature, phenomena or philosophical construct
- **Focus**: Research, experimentation, theory
- **Output**: Knowledge, models and insights
- **Mindset**: "Why does this happen? What are underlying laws? How can I control this?"

****
**Programmer**
****
- **Goal**: Writes code to implement logic, automate tasks or build software
- **Focus**: Algorithms, programming languages, debugging
- **Output**: Software applications, code, scripts
- **Mindset**: "How do I make this program run?"

****
**Engineering Workflow**
****
**CDIO Initiative** = formalising engineering educations
- **Conceive**
- **Design**
- **Implement**
- **Operate**

**CDIO** not sufficient, make it **CDIAO**:
- Conceive
- Design
- Implement
- **Assess**
- Operate

****
**Data Modelling**
****
**Data modelling** = modelling data requirements of a **miniworld** into a formal representation
- **Miniworld**: universe of discourse
- A restricted view on the real world with respect to problems that the application should solve

**Requirements Analysis**: 
- Database designers interview prospective **users** and **stakeholders**
- **Data Requirements**: what kind of data is needed?
- **Functional Requirements**: what kind of operations are performed on the data?

**Functional Analysis**: Describe high-level user operations and transactions

****
**Schema Design**
