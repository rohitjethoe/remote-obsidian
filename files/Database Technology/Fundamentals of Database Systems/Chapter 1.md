## 1.1: Introduction
---
A **database** = a collection of related data.

By **data**, we mean:
- known facts that can be recorded,
- and have implicit meaning

A database has the following implicit properties: 
1. **Miniworld:** It represents some aspect of the real world
2. **Logically coherent collection of data with some meaning:** 
	- A random assortment of data is NOT a database.
3. **Specific purpose**: is **designed**, **built** and **populated** with data for **a specific purpose** 

A **database management system (DBMS)** is used for **defining**, **constructing**, **manipulating**, and **sharing** databases
