## Grading
---
- **Database**: Midterm  $\Rightarrow$ 50%
- **Web**: Endterm           $\Rightarrow$ 50%
- **Resit**: either both or individually.

## Literature DB
---
**Fundamentals of Database System** Elmasri & Navathe, 7th edition.

## Expectations
---
Web & Database Technology is a **5 ECTS** course
- About **20 hours/week**.

## Information, Data and Knowledge?
---
**Information and Data Modelling**
<hr style="margin-top: 8px">

**DIKW Pyramid:**
	**D**ata
	**I**nformation: contextualizing data
	**K**nowledge: give meaning to information
	**W**isdom: gain insight from knowledge

**Information Theory:** 
	Idea that information decreases entropy or the uncertainty on the state of the world.

**Deep Learning**
<hr style="margin-top: 8px">

**Deep Learning** systems will only be 
	1. As smart as the **data it gets**.
	2. As smart as the **objective it optimizes**.

Only a small fraction of real-world ML systems is ML algorithm development. A lot of effort (80%) lies into **data management**.

**Into Databases**
<hr style="margin-top: 8px">

- **Database** = a collection of related data (represented using a data model and data schema)
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** = a software managing and maintaining a database.

Why databases and not just files?
1. Data Integrity & Consistency
2. Concurrency Control
3. Querying & Flexibility
4. Scalability & Performance
5. Security & Access Control
6. Backup & Recovery

- **Tier-1 Architecture:** Applications and Database on a single local machine.
	✅ Simple Architecture
	✅ Cheap
	❌ Limited to Single User
	❌ Bad Security
	❌ No Centralized Control

- **Tier-2 Architecture:** Clients (Apps + Users) communicate over network with DB
	✅ Easy Access and Deployments
	✅ Scalable
	✅ Low Cost
	❌ Security Issues
	❌ Difficult Maintenance
	❌ Limited Scalability
