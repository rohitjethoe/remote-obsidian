## Syllabus
****
After this course, the student is able to:
- [ ] translate a logically precise claim to and from natural language.
- [ ] describe the operation of logical connectors and quantifiers.
- [ ]  describe the notion of logical validity.
- [ ]  explain and apply basic set and graph operations.
- [ ] define and perform computations with functions, relations and equivalence classes.
- [ ] construct and interpret recursive definitions, including recursive data structures like trees.
- [ ] construct an appropriate function or relation given a description (in natural language or formal notation).
- [ ] construct a direct or indirect proof (by contradiction, division into cases, generalisation, or structural induction) or logical equivalence, or counterexample for (in)valid arguments, in propositional logic, predicate logic and set theory.
- [ ] identify what type of proof is appropriate for a given claim.
- [ ] solve simple SAT instances.
