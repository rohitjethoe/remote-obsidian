## Assignment

> The minimum of the personal process should be **>5.0**

**Continuous Contribution**
- Contribute code to the project
- Create MR's to allow others to review your code before merging
- Review others' MR and provide suggestions for improvement
- Approve MR that have a good quality

## Activity Tracking
---
**Expected Contributions**:
- **6** MR's approved and merged into the `main` branch
- Contribute **600** lines of Java code, out of which at least **300** lines are production code
- Contribute to both `server` and `client` (**100+ lines each**)
- Make **6** meaningful review comments

**Methodology**

*MR's are only counted when they:*
- target the `main` branch
- add Java source code
- are finished by the deadline: (they are merged or at least they are mergeable, not marked as draft and have a passing pipeline)

*Lines of Code:*
- We consider additions to `.java` files
- Not counting comments or whitespace
- Merge commits and revert commits are not counted
- We accumulate all code ever counted
- Commit dates attribute code contributions to a week
- For the end of course criteria, we count all contributed code that has been merged to main
- For weekly criteria we also consider code that is part of a finished MR

*Review comments are counted when:*
- they are meaningful (having **100+ characters** containing a statement about the code under review)
- the MR is created by someone else
- the MR contains additions to code files (`.java`, `.fxml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`)

| Week   | Lines of Code | MR's | Approvals | Comments |
| ------ | ------------- | ---- | --------- | -------- |
| 3      | 73            | 1    | 1         | 0        |
| 4      | 0             | 1    | 0         | 0        |
| 6      |               |      |           |          |
| 7      |               |      |           |          |
| 8      |               |      |           |          |
| 9      |               |      |           |          |
| Total: | 73            | 2    | 1         | 0        |

## Assessment

**Continuous Contribution:**
- Students who fail to reach >50% in one of the criteria (failed/no repair)
- Students who reach >50% in all criteria but fail to reach 100% (failed/repair)
- Students who reach the end of course criteria can still receive a penalty if they fail reaching weekly knockout criteria *more than once*
	- Missing 1 time: -0
	- Missing 2 times: -3
	- Missing 3 times: -3 (-6 in total, can still be repaired)
	- Missing 3 times: -3 (-9 in total, cannot be repaired)
